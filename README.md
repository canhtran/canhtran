### Hi, I'm Calvin 👋

I am a full-time data engineer and a part-time content creator.

- 🎓 My interests lie in Spark, Flink, and Airflow.
- 🔭 I am constantly building frameworks and tools, but unfortunately, never seem to have the time to complete a single one. If you are interested in collaborating on my projects, please do let me know.
- 📝 At present, I am learning Terraform.
- 😅 A fun fact: two years ago, I started a YouTube channel out of boredom and was pleasantly surprised when it gained popularity in the Vietnamese community.

I'm best reached via [email](trandcanh@gmail.com). I'm always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.
